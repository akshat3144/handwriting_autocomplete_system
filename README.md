# ✍️ Handwriting Autocomplete System

A deep learning–based system for **predicting and auto-completing handwriting** in real time. The system captures pen strokes, recognizes handwritten text, predicts the next word, and renders it in the user's handwriting style.

---

## 🧩 Pipeline Overview
The system operates in **four key stages**:

**1. Input Capture & Preprocessing**: Normalize and segment raw pen strokes.
**2. Handwriting Recognition**: Convert preprocessed strokes into digital text (**Strokes → Text**).
**3. Next-Word Prediction**: Use a language model to suggest the next words (**Text → Text**).
**4. Handwriting Style Synthesis**: Render predicted text in the user's handwriting style (**Text → Strokes/Image**).
